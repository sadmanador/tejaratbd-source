                        Over the recent past, Bangladesh has become strategically important for its geo-political and
                        geo-economical factors. For last two decades, the average GDP growth was over 7%. <br>

                        So, it is the prime time to strengthen the capabilities of our Armed Forces and Homeland
                        Security Services to support one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Our Govt. has rightly
                        appreciated and declared <b> “Forces Goal 2030,” </b> in order to modernising Bangladesh Armed
                        Forces to establish dominance over the Bay of Bengal and to become a regional military power.
                        <br>

                        To meet this challenge, DGDP is committed to purchase all hi-tech equipment and solutions across
                        the globe. <br>

                        We are having leading participants in the UN Peace Keeping Missions.Each year our Armed Forces
                        spend a big Defence budget for them as well.
                        <br>
                        At present, we are representing good number of manufacturers, custom build assemblers, and
                        authorized dealers from Western Europe, USA, Canada, and Australia.We further encourage and
                        invite others to join the winning team like “Tejarat International.” <br>

                        Bangladesh is now a heaven for foreign exporters and investers. As a member of Bangladesh
                        Indenting Agents' Association, we act as a “local agent” of our overseas counterparts, for
                        marketing their products and services to Bangladesh Armed Forces, Homeland Security Services,
                        and other Govt. and Private organizations in exchange for a "commission” in the form of Turn-Key
                        Projects, Development Projects, and Foreign Consultancies. <br>

                        We are enlisted in DGDP through the highest-level security clearance by DGFI (Directorate
                        General of Forces Intelligence). <br>
